Improving code readability is crucial for collaboration, maintenance, and debugging. Here are actionable strategies to enhance code readability:

---

### **1. Use Descriptive Naming**
   - **Variables and Methods:** Use names that clearly describe their purpose.
     ```java
     // Bad
     int x = 10;

     // Good
     int maxRetries = 10;
     ```
   - **Avoid abbreviations** unless they're widely understood (e.g., `id` for identifier).

---

### **2. Write Short and Focused Functions**
   - A function should do one thing and do it well. This makes it easier to understand and test.
     ```java
     // Bad
     void process() {
         // handles input, processes data, and prints output
     }

     // Good
     void handleInput() {}
     void processData() {}
     void printOutput() {}
     ```

---

### **3. Use Consistent Formatting**
   - **Indentation:** Follow the team's style guide for spaces or tabs.
   - **Braces:** Stick to one style (e.g., K&R or Allman).
   - **Line Length:** Keep lines short (e.g., 80-120 characters).
   - Use a linter or IDE formatter to enforce consistency.

---

### **4. Add Comments Judiciously**
   - Comment **why** a piece of code exists, not **what** it does.
   - Avoid redundant comments.
     ```java
     // Bad
     int maxRetries = 10; // Set maximum retries to 10.

     // Good
     // Retry limit to avoid overloading the system with requests.
     int maxRetries = 10;
     ```

---

### **5. Use Meaningful Constants**
   - Avoid magic numbers and strings.
     ```java
     // Bad
     double interest = balance * 0.05;

     // Good
     final double INTEREST_RATE = 0.05;
     double interest = balance * INTEREST_RATE;
     ```

---

### **6. Structure Code Logically**
   - **Group related logic together** (e.g., initialization, processing, cleanup).
   - Maintain a consistent order for method definitions (e.g., public → protected → private).

---

### **7. Avoid Deep Nesting**
   - Refactor nested logic using guards or early returns.
     ```java
     // Bad
     if (condition1) {
         if (condition2) {
             process();
         }
     }

     // Good
     if (!condition1 || !condition2) {
         return;
     }
     process();
     ```

---

### **8. Follow a Style Guide**
   - Adopt a standard style guide like:
     - Java: Google Java Style Guide.
     - JavaScript: Airbnb Style Guide.
   - Tools like **Prettier**, **Checkstyle**, or **ESLint** can enforce this.

---

### **9. Write Tests**
   - Tests serve as documentation and help clarify the intended behavior of the code.
     ```java
     @Test
     public void shouldReturnCorrectInterest() {
         // Arrange
         double balance = 1000.0;

         // Act
         double interest = calculateInterest(balance);

         // Assert
         assertEquals(50.0, interest);
     }
     ```

---

### **10. Use Design Patterns Wisely**
   - Applying well-known patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory) can make code easier to understand for experienced developers.

---

### **11. Avoid Over-Engineering**
   - Don’t add unnecessary abstractions or layers. Keep it simple (KISS principle).

---

### **12. Regularly Refactor**
   - Identify and improve areas of code that become hard to read over time.
   - Use tools like **IntelliJ's Refactor** or **SonarQube** for guidance.

---

### **13. Review and Pair Programming**
   - Code reviews help identify areas of improvement.
   - Pair programming promotes real-time readability discussions.
