Here is the outline a typical **code review process** many teams use. Feel free to share details if you'd like tailored suggestions for your team.

### Common Code Review Workflow:
1. **Developer Submits a Pull Request (PR):**
   - The developer writes and tests their code locally.
   - They push changes to a feature branch and create a PR to merge it into the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).

2. **Automated Checks:**
   - **CI/CD pipelines** run automated tests, linting, and static analysis.
   - If any checks fail, the developer must address them before reviewers look at the PR.

3. **Reviewer Assignment:**
   - Reviewers are assigned automatically (via code ownership) or manually by the author.
   - Teams often assign reviewers based on expertise, familiarity with the codebase, or workload balance.

4. **Review Begins:**
   - Reviewers assess the code for:
     - **Functionality:** Does it solve the problem or implement the feature correctly?
     - **Readability:** Is the code understandable and maintainable?
     - **Style:** Does it follow the team's coding standards?
     - **Performance:** Is it efficient? Could it impact system performance?
     - **Security:** Are there potential vulnerabilities?
     - **Testing:** Are there adequate tests, and do they cover edge cases?

5. **Feedback Provided:**
   - Reviewers leave comments or suggest changes directly on the PR.
   - Feedback might include questions, requests for clarification, or direct suggestions (e.g., code snippets).

6. **Revisions by the Author:**
   - The author addresses comments, makes changes, and pushes updates to the PR.
   - They may mark resolved comments or request clarification on feedback.

7. **Approval and Merging:**
   - Once all reviewers approve and all checks pass, the PR is merged into the target branch.
   - Some teams enforce multiple approvals for critical code or protected branches.

8. **Post-Merge Practices:**
   - Changes are deployed to staging or production environments, depending on the workflow.
   - Teams may hold retrospectives to discuss code quality or review processes.

### Tools for Code Review:
- **GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket:** For managing PRs and discussions.
- **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkstyle, or ESLint for catching bugs or style issues.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Slack or MS Teams for quick discussions about PRs.

### Best Practices:
- **Small PRs:** Easier to review and less prone to errors.
- **Clear Descriptions:** Authors should explain what the PR does and why.
- **Respectful Communication:** Foster a collaborative and respectful environment.
- **Regular Reviews:** Encourage frequent reviews to avoid bottlenecks.
