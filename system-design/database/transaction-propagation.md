Database propagation levels are associated with **transaction management** in frameworks like **Spring**. They define how transactional contexts are propagated when a method is called within a transaction. Unlike isolation levels (which control how transactions interact with each other), **propagation levels** determine the behavior of transactional boundaries when a method is executed.  

In Spring, propagation levels are defined in the `org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Propagation` enumeration. Here are the main types:

---

### **1. REQUIRED (Default)**
- **Description**: 
  - Joins the current transaction if one exists.
  - If no transaction exists, a new one is created.
- **Use Case**: 
  - The most common propagation type; suitable for most scenarios where a transaction context must exist.
- **Behavior**:
  - Reuses the parent transaction if available.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
public void method() {
    // Transaction logic here
}
```

---

### **2. REQUIRES_NEW**
- **Description**: 
  - Suspends the current transaction (if one exists) and creates a new transaction.
- **Use Case**: 
  - When a method must always run in a new transaction, independent of the caller’s transaction.
  - Useful for audit logging or retry mechanisms.
- **Behavior**:
  - Parent transaction is paused until the new transaction completes.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void method() {
    // Transaction logic here
}
```

---

### **3. SUPPORTS**
- **Description**: 
  - Executes within the current transaction if one exists.
  - If no transaction exists, the method executes non-transactionally.
- **Use Case**: 
  - Useful for methods that do not require a transaction but can work within one if provided.
- **Behavior**:
  - Optional transaction participation.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.SUPPORTS)
public void method() {
    // Logic can run in or out of a transaction
}
```

---

### **4. NOT_SUPPORTED**
- **Description**: 
  - Suspends the current transaction and executes the method outside of any transactional context.
- **Use Case**: 
  - Useful for operations that must not be part of a transaction, such as read-only methods or external API calls.
- **Behavior**:
  - Always non-transactional.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)
public void method() {
    // Non-transactional logic here
}
```

---

### **5. NEVER**
- **Description**: 
  - Ensures that the method is never executed within a transaction.
  - Throws an exception if a transaction exists.
- **Use Case**: 
  - For methods that must fail if a transaction context is active.
- **Behavior**:
  - Transactional enforcement to prevent execution within a transaction.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NEVER)
public void method() {
    // Non-transactional logic here
}
```

---

### **6. MANDATORY**
- **Description**: 
  - Requires an active transaction to execute.
  - Throws an exception if no transaction exists.
- **Use Case**: 
  - For methods that must always execute within an existing transaction.
- **Behavior**:
  - Enforces that a transaction context is mandatory.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.MANDATORY)
public void method() {
    // Requires an active transaction
}
```

---

### **7. NESTED**
- **Description**: 
  - Executes within a nested transaction if a parent transaction exists.
  - If the nested transaction rolls back, only its changes are undone, while the parent transaction can continue.
- **Use Case**: 
  - For scenarios where partial rollbacks are needed within a parent transaction.
- **Behavior**:
  - A savepoint is created for the nested transaction.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NESTED)
public void method() {
    // Nested transaction logic here
}
```

### Propagation Level Comparison

| Propagation Type    | Joins Current Transaction | Creates New Transaction | Requires Existing Transaction | Non-Transactional Execution |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| REQUIRED            | ✔                         | ✔ (if none exists)       | ✘                             | ✘                           |
| REQUIRES_NEW        | ✘                         | ✔                        | ✘                             | ✘                           |
| SUPPORTS            | ✔                         | ✘                        | ✘                             | ✔                           |
| NOT_SUPPORTED       | ✘                         | ✘                        | ✘                             | ✔                           |
| NEVER               | ✘                         | ✘                        | ✔ (throws exception)          | ✔                           |
| MANDATORY           | ✔                         | ✘                        | ✔ (throws exception)          | ✘                           |
| NESTED              | ✔                         | ✘ (uses savepoint)       | ✘                             | ✘                           |

### Best Practices
1. **REQUIRED**: Default; use when unsure.
2. **REQUIRES_NEW**: Use for independent operations, like logging or sending notifications.
3. **SUPPORTS**: For methods that can optionally participate in a transaction.
4. **NOT_SUPPORTED**: For operations where transactions add unnecessary overhead.
5. **NEVER**: Enforce strict transaction isolation.
6. **MANDATORY**: Ensure operations occur in a transaction context.
7. **NESTED**: Use for partial rollbacks within a transaction.
