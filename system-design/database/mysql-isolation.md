Database isolation levels in MySQL define how transactions interact with each other, particularly in terms of visibility and interference. They control the extent to which one transaction can see the changes made by other transactions, balancing **consistency**, **concurrency**, and **performance**. 

MySQL supports the following **four isolation levels**, aligned with the SQL standard:

---

### 1. **READ UNCOMMITTED**
   - **Description**: 
     - Transactions can see changes made by other transactions, even if those changes haven’t been committed yet.
     - This is the lowest isolation level.
   - **Issues**: 
     - **Dirty Reads**: A transaction can read uncommitted changes from another transaction.
   - **Usage**: Rarely used due to the risk of inconsistent data.
   - **Command**:
     ```sql
     SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
     ```

---

### 2. **READ COMMITTED**
   - **Description**: 
     - Transactions can only read committed changes from other transactions.
     - Changes made by a transaction are invisible to others until committed.
   - **Issues**: 
     - **Non-Repeatable Reads**: Repeated reads of the same data within a transaction may return different results if another transaction modifies the data and commits.
   - **Usage**: Ensures consistency but allows some concurrency. Popular in applications requiring real-time reads.
   - **Command**:
     ```sql
     SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
     ```

### 3. **REPEATABLE READ** (Default in MySQL)
   - **Description**: 
     - Ensures that if a transaction reads the same row twice, the result is the same.
     - Uses **gap locking** to prevent new rows from being inserted into ranges read by the current transaction.
   - **Issues**: 
     - Prevents **Dirty Reads** and **Non-Repeatable Reads**.
     - However, it does not prevent **Phantom Reads** (where new rows matching a query condition appear during the transaction).
   - **Usage**: Provides a good balance of consistency and concurrency. Suitable for most applications.
   - **Command**:
     ```sql
     SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
     ```

---

### 4. **SERIALIZABLE**
   - **Description**: 
     - Highest level of isolation; transactions are executed in a fully serializable manner.
     - Locks entire ranges of rows, ensuring no other transaction can read, write, or insert into the range being processed.
   - **Issues**: 
     - Prevents **Dirty Reads**, **Non-Repeatable Reads**, and **Phantom Reads**.
     - Significantly reduces concurrency.
   - **Usage**: Used when strong consistency is critical, such as in financial applications.
   - **Command**:
     ```sql
     SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
     ```

### Isolation Level Comparison

| Isolation Level      | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeatable Reads | Phantom Reads |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| READ UNCOMMITTED     | ✔           | ✔                     | ✔             |
| READ COMMITTED       | ✘           | ✔                     | ✔             |
| REPEATABLE READ      | ✘           | ✘                     | ✔             |
| SERIALIZABLE         | ✘           | ✘                     | ✘             |

### How to Set Isolation Level in MySQL
You can set the isolation level for:
1. **Session Scope**: Affects only the current session.
   ```sql
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <level>;
   ```
2. **Global Scope**: Affects all sessions unless overridden.
   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL <level>;
   ```

### Viewing the Current Isolation Level
To check the current isolation level:
```sql
SELECT @@TRANSACTION_ISOLATION;
```

### Best Practices
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: For use cases like analytics where data consistency isn't critical.
- **READ COMMITTED**: Good for systems requiring real-time updates with moderate consistency.
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Default in MySQL; ideal for most OLTP applications.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Use sparingly due to its impact on performance, typically in critical applications requiring full consistency.
