Let's break down the flow for your setup, step by step, involving an internal Kubernetes ingress, an external load balancer, an NGINX ingress controller, and Route 53.

### Components:

1. **Internal Ingress**: This is your Kubernetes ingress resource that maps incoming requests to services (`svc`) within the cluster.
2. **External Load Balancer (ELB)**: This is the AWS Load Balancer of type `LoadBalancer`, exposed externally to route traffic to your Kubernetes cluster. It sits in front of the NGINX ingress controller.
3. **NGINX Ingress Controller**: This is responsible for managing ingress resources and routing external traffic from the ELB to services inside the cluster.
4. **Route 53**: AWS's DNS service, which maps a domain name to the ELB’s DNS name, making it accessible from outside.

### Flow Breakdown:

1. **Client Request to Domain Name**:
    - A client sends a request (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) to a domain name, like `my-app.example.com`.
    - This domain name is managed by **Route 53**, which has a DNS record (likely an `A` or `CNAME` record) pointing to the external **AWS ELB** DNS name (e.g., `my-elb-12345.region.elb.amazonaws.com`).
2. **Route 53 DNS Resolution**:
    - **Route 53** resolves the domain name (`my-app.example.com`) to the DNS name of the ELB.
    - The client now sends the request directly to the **AWS ELB**.
3. **ELB (Load Balancer) Routing**:
    - The **AWS ELB** (configured as a `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` in your Kubernetes cluster) receives the request. The ELB balances traffic and forwards it to one of the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.
    - The ELB sends the traffic to a node that is running the **NGINX Ingress Controller** pod.
4. **NGINX Ingress Controller**:
    - The **NGINX Ingress Controller** (which is configured via Kubernetes ingress resources) inspects the request, particularly looking at the host header (`my-app.example.com`) and the path (e.g., `/api`).
    - Based on the ingress rules defined in the Kubernetes ingress resource, the **NGINX Ingress Controller** routes the traffic to the appropriate **Kubernetes Service (svc)** within the cluster.

   For example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: my-app-ingress
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: "my-app.example.com"
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app-service
                port:
                  number: 80
    
    ```

    - The ingress controller uses the **Ingress Resource** to map `/api` requests on `my-app.example.com` to the **service** `my-app-service`.
5. **Service to Pod Communication**:
    - Once the **NGINX Ingress Controller** decides which Kubernetes **Service** should handle the request, it forwards the traffic to that service.
    - The service load balances the traffic among the backend **Pods** that are part of that service.
    - The pod processes the request, performs the necessary computation or action, and then returns the response.
6. **Response Flow**:
    - The response from the pod is sent back through the **Service**, then back to the **NGINX Ingress Controller**.
    - The **NGINX Ingress Controller** forwards the response to the **AWS ELB**, which sends it back to the client via the public internet.

### Summary:

- **Route 53** maps the domain (`my-app.example.com`) to the DNS name of the **AWS ELB**.
- The **AWS ELB** directs traffic to a Kubernetes node, where the **NGINX Ingress Controller** is running.
- The **NGINX Ingress Controller** uses the **Ingress Resource** to determine which **Kubernetes Service** should handle the request.
- The service routes the traffic to the appropriate **Pods**.
- The response travels back through the same path (Pods → Service → NGINX → ELB → Client).

### Diagrammatic Overview:

```
Client → Route 53 (DNS: my-app.example.com)
       → AWS ELB (my-elb-12345.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
       → NGINX Ingress Controller (inside Kubernetes)
       → Kubernetes Service
       → Pods
       → (Response back through the same path)

```

This flow ensures that external traffic can be securely routed to the appropriate internal services within your Kubernetes cluster using the ELB and NGINX ingress controller.
